# Changelog

## Unreleased

- T1.0: the repository bootstraps with its document pairs (README, AGENTS, CHANGELOG), the
  `.flowmark/` ignore rule and this execution checklist pair.
- T1.1: the design plan folds the three-lane adversarial audit into rulings — the executor seam
  in orm, two-clause idempotency, dbspec-driven frontmatter embedding, the prepare-record commit
  protocol with one portable per-operation lock, restrict-only foreign keys, the rejected
  identity column, type-directed ordering, adapter-based sync.
- T1.2: the repository vendors polyspec/kit whole-directory with its lock (`make kit-sync`,
  `make kit-check`) and configures the trackers: config/checklist.json reads the
  execution-checklist pair with the five states and config/documents.json selects the document
  pairs and the changelog; `make documents-check` passes.
